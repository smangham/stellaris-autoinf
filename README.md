[b]Version 3.14.*[/b]

As midgame rolls round, your Hyper Relay network will gradually want upgrading to Gateways. However, whilst it's easy to build a Hyper Relay from the galaxy map, the same is not true of Gateways... requiring multiple stages of upgrade. This mod tries to make it a bit less of a faff.

[h1]Automate Infrastructure[/h1]
After you've built at least one Gateway the traditional way (with a construction ship, or by upgrading a ruined Gateway), then your Hyper Relays will have the option to 'upgrade' to a Gateway.

This costs as much as building a new Gateway, and takes as long, but is a single click that doesn't require fiddly construction ship admin. Once the 'upgrade' is complete, a Gateway will be spawned; leaving the system with [b]both a Hyper Relay and a Gateway[/b].

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod changes no files. It will conflict with other mods that provide an upgrade option for Hyper Relays, but that's it. It even makes sure the final Gateway and Hyper Relay are the default, vanilla versions at the end!
